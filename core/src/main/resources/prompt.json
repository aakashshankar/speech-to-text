Your difficulty concentrating at work could be a direct result of these headaches, which is likely exacerbated by stress. The occasional nausea you're experiencing, while not severe, is also common with tension-type headaches. Notably, your trouble sleeping is significant, as poor sleep quality can contribute to the frequency and intensity of headaches. While your symptoms don't immediately suggest a serious underlying condition, a thorough examination is essential. Meanwhile, implementing stress management techniques and improving your sleep hygiene could help alleviate your symptoms."
